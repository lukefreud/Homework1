Data scientists do not always receive cleaned data and they must manipulate and add to it in order to get it in the form they want. Statisticians usually receive data that is mostly cleaned already, and they focus more of the time on advanced modeling of the data.\n\n\n\nI view myself as more of a data scientist than a statistician. I actually enjoy the end-to-end process and dealing with data more so I can get it into a form that is needed for my statistical tests. I also really enjoy interpreting my results of the data in terms of the big-picture question, which I feel a data scientist does more than a statistician."
